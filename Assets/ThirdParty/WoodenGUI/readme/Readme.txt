Greetings, stranger!
We are happy, that you choosing our assets.
This project may seem to be a little confusing, but it is very simple.

- Every big button on click calls corresponding DialogInit class. 
- Every corresponding DialogInit class is overrided Dialog class with appropriate variables for this dialog.
- Dialog.Open() calls animation, when animation completed it calls via AnimationEvent Dialog.OpenComplete. Same is for Dialog.Close().
- Shop and Rating imoplemented using panel, so you can easy populate it via arrays.
